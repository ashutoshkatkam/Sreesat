Measurement sensors for a Cubesat

Introduction: 
	Measurement team 1 is aimed to deal with all the sensors and the algorithms for calculating the required values for the cube sat in the following areas:
1.	GPS (Longitude, Latitude, Altitude, SNR, Velocity, Satellite Numbers, Azimuth) 
2.	Sun Radiation (UV index, IR and visible light Intensity)
3.	Weather Monitoring (Pressure, Humidity, Temperature)


  Work assigned: 
1.	Interface all the sensors with Arduino UNO and calibrate the sensors.
2.	Modify/Rewrite the libraries present for the sensors for the more accurate calculation.
3.	Store the data from the sensors in an array format converting them to a binary array.
4.	Sending the Data format to the on-board software team for decoding the information.


  Work Completed:
1.	Interface all the sensors with Arduino UNO and calibrate the sensors.
2.	Modify/Rewrite the libraries present for the sensors for the more accurate calculation.
